# Letter to future myself
It's great that I start doing all this stuff, but listen I'm not good at scripts and now `2022-09-10` I don't know how to do this...

### You really wanted to use Sway due to Wayland

Yeah, you ... I mean "I" wanted to use it, because I've heard that the Wayland is great.
So, first of all, you install the latest Ubuntu, then change Nvidia drivers, because it's unsupported, and then `sudo apt install sway`. You've found a funny way how to check if the Wayland is works. `Alt+F2` and then `r`.

```
    Install Ubuntu
    Check if Wayland is working
        You can use opensource drivers for Nvidia
    sudo apt install sway
```

### In Sway you use `kitty`, `nvim`

You tried so hard to understand how to customize all that stuff, and you managed it. Install `kitty`, `nvim`, and then run script to create semilinks.
By the way you use `zsh`.

```
    install kitty
    install zsh and oh-my-zsh
    install nvim
    run install.sh
```
### Finally

And that's it. That how you've installed your enviroment, I hope future you will make something more elegant.
