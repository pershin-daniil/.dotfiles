## Steps to bootstrap

1. Install git

```zsh
sudo apt install git
```


2. Clone repo into new hidden directory.

```zsh
# use HTTPS and switch remotes later.
git clone https://github.com/pppershin/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```


3. Create symlinks in the Home directory to the real files in the repo.

```zsh
# There are better and less manual ways to do this;
# investigate install scripts and bootstrapping tools.

ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```


4. Install Homebrew, followed by the software listed in the Brewfile.

```zsh
# These could also be in an install script.

# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrewinstall/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then pass in the Brewfile location...
brew bundle --file ~/.dotfiles/Brewfile

# ...or move to the directory first.
cd ~/.dotfiles && brew bundle
```
